Smart Presence Detection (Edge AI Interface)
A high-precision distance monitoring system using Arduino Uno and HC-SR04, featuring a custom Digital Signal Filter for noise reduction.

Technical Documentation

Key Features
Noise Reduction: Implements a Moving Average Filter (5-sample buffer) to eliminate signal jitter.

Intelligent Logic: 100cm threshold for high-accuracy state transitions (Standby vs. Active).

Visual Feedback: Dual-LED interface for immediate system status.

System Architecture
Simulation Results
The system was verified via Tinkercad, showing 100% stability in detection logic with zero false-positives under filtered conditions.
